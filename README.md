## Labs

(1) This program solves a partial differential equation on (N+2) Ã— (N+2) grid (2D), in a parallel fashion; that is, it performs Gauss-Seidel sweeps over the grid until convergence.

Two solutions are explored in this program, namely:
* Red-Black Cells Approach
* Anti-Diagonals Approach

In each case, the following parallelization techniques were tried out and the results were compared:
* Sequential Implementation
* Parallel Implementation with <b>OpenMP</b>
  - using <i>#pragma omp critical</i>
  - using per-thread <i>diff</i> variable (no padding)
  - using per-thread <i>diff</i> variable (with padding)
* Parallel Implementation with <b>Pthreads (POSIX Threads)</b>
  - using mutex lock
  - using per-thread <i>diff</i> variable (no padding)
  - using per-thread <i>diff</i> variable (with padding)
